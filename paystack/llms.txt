# Paystack Documentation

> Paystack is Africa's leading payments infrastructure provider, enabling businesses to accept payments from customers via cards, bank accounts, mobile money, USSD, QR codes, and bank transfers. This documentation covers integration guides, SDKs, webhooks, and best practices for building payment experiences.

Paystack operates in Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Kenya, and Cote d'Ivoire. The platform supports both online and in-person payments through various integration methods including Popup JS, Redirect, Mobile SDKs, and Terminal devices.

Key concepts:
- All API requests require authentication with secret keys (server-side) or public keys (client-side)
- Test mode allows development without real transactions using test API keys
- Webhooks provide real-time notifications for transaction events
- Transactions should always be verified server-side before delivering value
