# Moniepoint

> Moniepoint Inc. is a CBN-licensed financial institution providing payment and banking services for businesses and consumers, primarily in Nigeria.

Moniepoint operates as a CBN-licensed Switch, Processor, and Microfinance Bank, with its B2B payment gateway under the Monnify brand (developers.monnify.com). It supports NGN payments via cards, bank transfers, USSD, reserved virtual accounts, direct debits, and offline cash collections. API authentication is a two-step process: Basic auth (apiKey:secretKey) to obtain a Bearer JWT, then using this JWT for subsequent requests. All monetary values are in NGN kobo subunits, Moniepoint MFB deposits are NDIC-insured, and operations comply with the Nigeria Data Protection Act 2023.

Important notes:
- API authentication requires a POST /api/v1/auth/login with Basic auth (base64 of apiKey:secretKey) to get an accessToken JWT, then using "Authorization: Bearer {accessToken}" for all requests.
- All monetary amounts in API requests and responses are specified in kobo (e.g., 10000 for NGN 100.00).
- Always verify transaction status server-side using GET /api/v2/merchant/transactions/query?transactionReference={ref}; never rely solely on client-side callbacks or webhooks for critical logic.
- Validate incoming webhook requests by computing a SHA-512 HMAC of the raw request body using your merchant secret key and comparing it against the 'monnify-signature' header.
- Use `https://sandbox.monnify.com` for testing and `https://api.monnify.com` for live production API interactions.

## Payment Channels

Monnify supports multiple payment channels per transaction. The customer selects their preferred channel at checkout.

**Cards:** Visa, Mastercard, Verve. Supports PIN entry, OTP (2FA), and 3DS flows. Test cards available in sandbox.
**Bank Transfer:** Monnify generates a dynamic virtual account number per transaction. Customer transfers exact amount → webhook fires on receipt.
**USSD:** Customer dials their bank's USSD shortcode and enters the transaction amount. No internet required on customer side.
**Reserved Virtual Account:** Permanent virtual account assigned to a specific customer for all-time reconciliation. Payments credited instantly.
**Direct Debit:** Mandate-based recurring pulls from customer bank account. Routes via TeamApt or NIBSS. Requires mandate authorization link sent to customer.
**Offline Pay-in:** Customer pays cash at any Moniepoint agent (present in every LGA in Nigeria). Merchant gets SUCCESSFUL_TRANSACTION webhook with paymentMethod: "CASH".
**Payment Links:** No-code hosted payment pages. Create via dashboard or POST /api/v1/invoice/create.

### Direct Debit Mandate Types

- **Open Flexible** — varying amounts, no end date (e.g. utility billing based on usage)
- **Open Fixed** — fixed amount, no end date (e.g. streaming subscription)
- **Closed Flexible** — varying amounts with end date (e.g. instalment plan)
- **Closed Fixed** — fixed amount with end date (e.g. insurance premiums)

Mandate authorization link valid for 30 days. Status transitions: PENDING → ACTIVATED / FAILED / CANCELLED.

## Test Credentials

Sandbox base URL: `https://sandbox.monnify.com`. Production: `https://api.monnify.com`.

**Sandbox merchant credentials (do not hard-code in source control):**
- API Key: Typically starts with `MK_TEST_` and is obtained from your Monnify dashboard.
- Secret Key: Long random string generated in your Monnify dashboard. Treat as a secret and load from environment variables (for example, `MONNIFY_SECRET_KEY`) rather than committing it.
- Contract Code: Numeric string assigned to your contract in the Monnify dashboard (for example, a 10‑digit number).

For up-to-date sample/test credentials and setup instructions, see the official Monnify docs: https://developers.monnify.com/

**Test cards (examples only, do not store full PANs here):**
- Monnify provides different sandbox test cards to simulate flows such as:
  - Successful card transactions without OTP
  - Transactions that require OTP
  - 3-D Secure (3DS) authentication flows
  - Declined or failing card scenarios

Use only the official test card numbers from the Monnify documentation during development and testing; never use real customer card data in sandbox.

# API Reference

> The Monnify REST API (Moniepoint's payment gateway). **Sandbox:** `https://sandbox.monnify.com` | **Production:** `https://api.monnify.com`

Auth: POST `/api/v1/auth/login` with `Authorization: Basic base64(apiKey:secretKey)` → returns `accessToken` JWT. Use `Authorization: Bearer {accessToken}` on all subsequent calls. Token expires — re-authenticate proactively.

All responses: `{ requestSuccessful: boolean, responseMessage: string, responseCode: string, responseBody: object }`. Amounts in **kobo** (NGN). Always verify transactions server-side before delivering value — never trust client callbacks alone.

## Webhooks

Configure webhook URLs in Monnify dashboard → Developer → Webhook URLs. Set separate URLs for: Transaction Completion, Refund Completion, Disbursement, Settlement.

**Signature validation (mandatory):** Compute SHA-512 HMAC of the raw JSON request body using your merchant secret key. Compare to the hash in the `monnify-signature` request header. Reject any request where hashes don't match.

**Best practices:** Respond HTTP 200 immediately, process async. Handle duplicate deliveries idempotently. Whitelist Monnify IP ranges. Retry logic is built into Monnify — don't manually retry on your side.
