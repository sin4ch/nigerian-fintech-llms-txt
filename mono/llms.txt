# Mono Banking API Documentation

> Mono is an African open banking platform that provides APIs for accessing financial data, initiating payments, and verifying identities. Mono enables fintechs, lenders, and businesses to securely connect to users' bank accounts across Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa.

Important notes:

- All API requests require authentication using the `mono-sec-key` header with your App secret key
- Mono provides two environments: Sandbox (free testing) and Live (production with wallet funding required)
- Currency values in API responses are in the lowest denomination (NGN: kobo, GHC: pesewa, KSH/ZAR: cents)
- The Mono Connect Widget is used to securely link user accounts via SDK or Connect Link
